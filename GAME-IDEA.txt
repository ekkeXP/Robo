GAME IDEA

You are a spherical robot in a post apocalipse setting.

Your battery is leaking.

You roll around to return to the factory where you were made.

Along the way you encounter other robots, but they have been programmed to go after you and stop you from your path.

There are also a number of safehouses that emit enough static electricity to charge your battery again.
Here you are safe from the other robots.
